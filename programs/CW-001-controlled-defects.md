# CrystalWorks Program CW-001
## Controlled Defect Density in Synthetic Diamond

### Program Type
Research / Measurement / Infrastructure Validation

---

## Hypothesis
Controlled variation in defect density can be:
- repeatably achieved
- measured with standard lab techniques
- correlated with process metadata
without requiring new physics.

---

## Why This Matters
- Jewelry ignores defects
- Industry values them
- Quantum, optical, and thermal applications depend on them

The bottleneck is **control and repeatability**, not theory.

---

## Scope
- Use existing DiamondOps operational primitives
- No bypass of safety systems
- No new hazardous regimes
- Measurement-focused

---

## Measurement Plan (Metadata-Level)
- Photoluminescence report reference
- Raman / FTIR report reference
- YieldOS run_record correlation
- Defect density classification bands

---

## Risk Profile
**R1** — Parameter exploration within established safety envelope.

---

## Success Criteria
- ≥3 runs with measurable, distinct defect profiles
- All runs traceable via YieldOS
- Measurement reproducibility documented

---

## Output
- Measurement framework
- Data correlation methodology
- Infrastructure validation for future CrystalWorks programs
