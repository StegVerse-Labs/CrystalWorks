# CrystalWorks

CrystalWorks is the controlled frontier: experimental programs for advanced synthetic crystals that use DiamondOps operational primitives.

## Scope (v0.1)
- Program templates
- Risk profiling conventions
- Research-mode metadata aligned to DiamondOps-Core

CrystalWorks avoids unsafe step-by-step “how-to” instructions.
It focuses on governance, measurement plans, and traceability.
